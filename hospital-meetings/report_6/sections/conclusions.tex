\section*{Conclusions}

To summarise, in this report we address a succinct description of our pre-release user tests. The tests aim to be a set of \hyperlink{https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pilot-testing/}{pilot tests} that will guide our future testing protocols. Also, the tests serve to gave us more clinical domain context, for instance, we describe the importance of the different shapes and distributions of the micro-calcifications. Not forgetting, the several issues of the system we found and usability holes that need to be improved. The overall of this report is positive and the tests should remain on our research workflow.
